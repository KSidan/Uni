    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <p>My name is Rambanang Sidan Lanang. I am a computer science student currently studying the basics of HTML. I am 20
        years old as of 23rd of January 2024. </p>

    <ol type="a">

    </ol>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p style="text-align: center;">I was told to center a quote, so this text is said quote.</p>
    <a href="HobbyPage.html">Click here to go to my brief Hobby Page!</a>
    <br><br>
    <p>In another objective, i am told to insert an image. So here it is:</p>
    <center>
        <img src="..\images\rafathar.jpg" width="540" height="406">
    </center>
    <br><br>
    <center>
        <h1>MOVING ONTO FAMILIES!</h1>
        <p>its nothing much really</p>
        <table border=1>
            <tr>
                <th>Position</th>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Website</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Dad</td>
                <td>Hars***</td>
                <td align="center" rowspan="3">None</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Mother</td>
                <td>K*******</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>My beloved older sister:</td>
                <td>Ajeng Garita Wikurestri</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </center>
    <br><br>
    <div>Then, i am instructed to construct a part of the page where there is colour. Although, i had a
        hard time
        finding out on how i could do it with purely HTML and without inline CSS syntaxes.</div>
    <br>
    <p>And here is several websites that i used during learning to code this simple website:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">geeksforgeeks.com</a></li>
    </ul>
