	<p>Before that, a bit of a background.</p>
	<br>
	<p>From since i was a small kid, i was exposed to video games. I remember watching my cousin play the ps2 at the
		time it was launched, and im stoked. At the time, there were all kinds of games that he played, but the one that
		stuck with me was a military game called Ace Combat.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Ace Combat in short, was an arcade style plane game where the player pilots a fighter jet. I was mesmerized by
		it. Since then, it was my calling to try and get into the military and go into the air force. But alas, one day
		in junior high, i had an accident which made me semi disabled (kind of) for life. Since then, ive been trying to
		find ways to at least work in the aviation industry however i can, and in the meantime, i play games related to
		it.</p>
